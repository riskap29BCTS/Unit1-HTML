        <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <h3>Favorite hobby</h3>
                <p><strong><em>My favorite hobby I picked up this spring is playing board games with friends; however, our games are a lot more complex than the "monopoly", and the "apples to apples" type of board games that people associate with the term. We play board games with situational thinking; where phyrric victory is common, and game ending plays are right around each corner. I especially like board games with a political dependency built into them, like "arcs," where each person fights to secure a court, others' favor, and their own goals. Our group's favorite board game is one called "Root." I was really passionate about it, and my friends also boarded that ship over time</em></strong></p>
            <h3>Other things I like</h3>
                <p><b>I</b> enjoy biking, taekwondo, running, video games, fine cuisine, <em>especially listening to music</em>, working, and spending time with friends and family</p>
